  <comment>EPSG and AUTO authority factories are defined for data.crs.CRSService.
    These codes are used to provide CoordinateRegerenceSystem for GCE and
    DataStore implementations that do not define their own native definition.
  
    Contains a Property file based CoordinateSystemAuthority (the property file 
    is too large to be included in the main geotools release). This class will 
    need to be ported to the new GeoAPI CoordinateReferenceSystem interfaces.</comment>
