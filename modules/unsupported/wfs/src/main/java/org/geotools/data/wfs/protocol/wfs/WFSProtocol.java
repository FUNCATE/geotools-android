/**
 * Facade interface to interact with a WFS instance.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface know how to send and get information back from a WFS service
 * for a specific protocol version, but are <b>not</b> meant to provide any logic other than the
 * conversation with the service. For instance, {@code WFSProtocol} implementations are not required
 * to transform {@link Filter filters} to something appropriate for the service capabilities, nor
 * any other control logic than creating and sending the requests mapping what is given to the
 * operation methods.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface provides enough information extracted or derived from the WFS capabilities
 * document as for the client code to issue requests appropriate for the server capabilities.
