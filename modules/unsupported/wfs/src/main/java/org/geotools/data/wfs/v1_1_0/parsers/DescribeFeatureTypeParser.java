/**
 * This class is meant to parse a WFS DescribeFeatureType response but is not yet engaged.
 * <p>
 * NOTE there are currently technical limitations to engage the DescribeFeatureType request/response
 * to the {@link WFSResponseParserFactory}/{@link WFSResponseParser} architecture. This technical
 * limitations have to be with the fact that the {@link Parser} and
 * {@link ApplicationSchemaConfiguration configuration} used to parse a response need a direct
 * handle to the DescribeFeatureType request URL and have no way to directly parse from the plain
 * response {@link InputStream}.
 * So, for the time being, the request/response handling for GetFeatureType is being made in an ad-hoc
 * manner inside {@link WFS_1_1_0_DataStore#getSchema(String)}
